**Domain:** NLP, Machine Learning, Weak Supervision  
**Status:** Academic Prototype (Bachelor's Thesis Project)

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect deceptive (spam) reviews in Turkish e-commerce platforms using a **Hybrid Feature Fusion** approach. Unlike traditional methods, this system combines:

1. Contextual Embeddings generated by **BERTurk** (Transformer-based)
2. Textual Features using TF-IDF vectors for lexical patterns
3. Heuristic Structural Analysis through a rule-based weak supervision module to handle unlabeled data

The model addresses the lack of large-scale labeled Turkish datasets by employing a **Weak Supervision** strategy, generating *Silver Labels* based on structural heuristics (e.g., text length, generic pattern density) before training a robust classifier.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```python
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/turkish-spam-detection.git
   cd turkish-spam-detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```


3. Prepare the data:

   Place your raw CSV file (`veri_seti_200k.csv`) into the `data/raw/` directory.

   **Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to privacy and size constraints.

## Usage

### Training the Model

To preprocess data, generate weak labels, and train the hybrid model:

```bash
python train.py
```

### Testing / Inference

To test the model with a single sentence input (live demo):

```bash
python predict.py
```

## Methodology

### Weak Supervision (The Labeling Problem)

Since the dataset was unlabeled, a heuristic labeling function (`src/heuristics.py`) assigns labels based on:

- **Brevity Penalty:** Extremely short reviews are flagged
- **Generic Density:** Reviews consisting mostly of filler words (e.g., "harika", "süper") are flagged
- **Structural Complexity:** Reviews containing digits and sufficient length are considered genuine

### Hybrid Feature Fusion

The classifier receives a concatenated feature vector:

V_final = V_BERT ⊕ V_TF-IDF

This enables the model to capture both deep semantic representations (BERT) and keyword-based lexical patterns (TF-IDF).

## Results (Preliminary)

- **Accuracy:** Approximately 90%
- **F1-Score (Spam Class):** Approximately 0.82

Results may vary depending on the random sampling seed.
